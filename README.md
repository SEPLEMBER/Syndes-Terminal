# Android Terminal Emulator

A small, handy terminal for Android. Unlike Termux, it doesn’t run a virtual system — everything works directly with Android itself.

## What it can do

- A variety of familiar Linux-style commands.
- Support for simple scripts and batch operations.
- Experimental background mode (`watchdog`).

## Note

The app is signed with a **test signature** due to technical limitations.  
If you are concerned about that, feel free to rebuild the APK manually.  
Since the signature itself does not protect against tampering, a test one was used for simplicity.

It is recommended to download the APK from **syndes rep** or from the **Releases** section of this repository.  
Even though it uses a test signature, the APK is a **release build** with debugging disabled.
